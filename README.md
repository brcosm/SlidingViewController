SlidingViewController
=====================

Simple sliding view controller implementation that works well with iOS7

Manages two view controllers:

* ContentViewController: Contains main content

* MenuViewController: Contains accessory content like menus

Use a pan gesture to slide them menu over the main content.  Plan to support left and right sides, currently only supports right.
